# Body Fat Study

Accurate measurement of body fat is inconvenient/costly and it is desirable to have easy methods of estimating body fat that are not inconvenient/costly. In this project, we come up with a simple, robust, and accurate model (i.e. “rule-of-thumb”) to estimate percentage of body fat using clinically available measurements. Our “rule-of-thumb” will be based on a real data set of *252* men with measurements of their percentage of body fat and various body circumference measurements.
